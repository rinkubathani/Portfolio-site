# Udacity Portfolio

## Overview

Build a portfolio site using HTML & CSS that replicates the design mockup. Develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.
However, students were permitted to implement custom changes to the design rather than fierce adherence to the design mockup.
Bootstrap was used for the design.

### Project Rubric

##### The page at minimum includes all of the following:
 * at least 4 images
